# Dead by Clipboard [[EN](README.md) | [RU](README.ru.md)]
This Python program allows you to use the clipboard in the game Dead by Daylight. It uses the `pyperclip` library to perform clipboard operations on Windows.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository or download the ZIP file and extract it.
2. Install the required libraries by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the project directory.

## Usage
1. Start the Dead by Daylight game.
2. Run the `DeadByClipboard.py` script in the project directory.
3. Press Ctrl+V to paste the copied item in the game.
- If you want to turn off the program, then press F8

## Roadmap & Future Developments
- Use fewer libraries
- Project optimization
- Add the compiled version of the program to releases

## Known Issues
- In cases of compilation, Windows Defender and some other antivirus applications may report a threat. This may be related to the libraries used to compile the application.


> **_NOTE:_** This is my first public plan program, do not judge strictly.
